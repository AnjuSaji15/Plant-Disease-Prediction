1.	OBJECTIVE

The objective of this project is to develop a deep learning model that accurately classifies plant diseases from leaf images, leveraging the PlantVillage dataset. The model aims to assist farmers and agriculturalists in early disease detection by providing a user-friendly interface for image-based diagnosis, reducing crop losses through timely intervention.

2.	INTRODUCTION

Plant diseases pose significant threats to global agriculture, causing substantial yield losses and economic damage. Early and accurate diagnosis is critical for effective disease management. Traditional methods rely on manual inspection by experts, which is time-consuming and often impractical for large-scale farming. Advances in deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), offer a promising solution by automating image-based disease classification with high accuracy.
This project utilizes the PlantVillage dataset, which contains over 50,000 images of plant leaves across 38 disease and healthy classes, covering 14 crop species. A CNN model is trained to classify these images, and a Gradio-based web interface is developed to enable users to upload leaf images for real-time disease prediction. The system aims to provide a scalable, accessible tool for farmers to diagnose plant health efficiently.

3.	METHODOLOGY
The methodology encompasses data collection, preprocessing, model development, training, evaluation, and deployment. The following steps outline the approach:

i.	Dataset Acquisition:
•	The PlantVillage dataset was sourced from Kaggle, containing colored images organized into 38 classes (e.g., Apple__Cedar_apple_rust, Tomato__Healthy).
•	Only the color images were used, as they retain critical visual features like disease-specific discoloration.
ii.	Data Preprocessing:
•	Images were resized to 224x224 pixels to standardize input dimensions.
•	Pixel values were normalized (divided by 255) to scale them between 0 and 1.
•	The dataset was split into 80% training and 20% validation sets using ImageDataGenerator 
with a validation split of 0.2.
iii.	Model Architecture:
•	A sequential CNN model was designed with two convolutional layers (32 and 64 filters, 3x3 kernels, ReLU activation), each followed by max-pooling (2x2).
•	The feature maps were flattened and passed through a dense layer (256 units, ReLU) and an output layer with softmax activation for 38-class classification.
iv.	Training:
•	The model was compiled with the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.
•	Training was conducted for 5 epochs with a batch size of 32, using a GPU-enabled Google Colab environment to handle the computational load.
v.	Evaluation:
•	Model performance was assessed using accuracy and loss metrics on the validation set during training.
•	The training process took approximately 4 hours, indicating the computational intensity of processing ~50,000 images.
vi.	Deployment:
•	A prediction pipeline was created to preprocess user-uploaded images and output class labels with confidence scores.
•	A Gradio interface was implemented to provide an interactive web-based platform for users to upload images and receive predictions.

4.	DESIGN and IMPLEMENTATION

i.	Dataset Handling
•	Source: The PlantVillage dataset was downloaded via Kaggle’s API and extracted to obtain color images stored in plantvillage dataset/color.
•	Structure: The dataset includes 38 subdirectories, each representing a class (e.g., Apple___Cedar_apple_rust). A sample image inspection confirmed dimensions of 256x256x3, resized to 224x224 for training.
•	Preprocessing: ImageDataGenerator facilitated on-the-fly data augmentation (only rescaling was applied) and split the dataset into training (~43,000 images) and validation (~10,000 images) sets.

ii.	Model Architecture
The CNN model was designed as follows:
•	Input Layer: Accepts 224x224x3 RGB images.
•	Conv2D (32 filters): Extracts low-level features (e.g., edges, textures) with 3x3 kernels and ReLU activation.
•	MaxPooling2D: Reduces spatial dimensions to 112x112, retaining key features.
•	Conv2D (64 filters): Captures higher-level patterns (e.g., disease spots).
•	MaxPooling2D: Further downsamples to 56x56.
•	Flatten: Converts feature maps to a 1D vector.
•	Dense (256 units): Learns complex patterns with ReLU activation.
•	Output Layer: Produces probabilities for 38 classes using softmax.

iii.	Training Process
•	Environment: Google Colab with GPU acceleration.
•	Hyperparameters:
•	Optimizer: Adam (default learning rate).
•	Loss: Categorical cross-entropy.
•	Batch size: 32.
•	Epochs: 5 (to balance training time and convergence).
•	Data Flow: train_generator and validation_generator supplied batches of preprocessed images, with steps per epoch calculated as samples // batch_size.

iv.	Prediction Pipeline
•	Function: load_and_preprocess_image resizes user images to 224x224, converts to RGB if needed, normalizes, and adds a batch dimension.
•	Prediction: predict_image_class uses the model to predict the class index, maps it to a class name via class_indices, and returns the label with confidence.
•	Interface: classify_plant_disease saves the uploaded image temporarily, calls the prediction function, and returns the image and result for display.

v.	Gradio Interface
•	Inputs: Accepts a PIL image via an upload widget.
•	Outputs: Displays the uploaded image and a textbox with the predicted class and confidence (e.g., “Predicted: Tomato___Late_blight (Confidence: 95.23%)”).
•	Launch: Hosted locally in Colab, accessible via a public URL during runtime.
